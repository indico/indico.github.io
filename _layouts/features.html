You will never need to bring with that USB flash drive ever again, or mail yourself PPT files. Your participants will be able to easily find what is going on in your organisation and access presentation materials from anywhere.</p>

                        <p>Building a registration form would be a tedious task, were it not for Indico's WYSIWYG form designer. Timetables can be easily managed using a powerful "drag and drop" interface. Rich text? Mathematical formulae? We have them! We are constantly trying to make Indico simpler to use and more user-friendly.</p>

                        <h2>HIERARCHICAL PROTECTION SCHEME</h2>
                        <p>Indico was built with a large organisation in mind (CERN). This is why events are organised using a hierarchy of categories and protection of resources can be defined at several granularity levels. From small schools to large enterprises, Indico is the intuitive solution for organised and secure event storage.</p>

                        <p>Indico won't keep you data hostage. We believe in open collaborative platforms, and this is why we provide a simple and powerful REST API that allows for easy retrieval of information. The API is in constant expansion. You can also export your event data from your favorite scheduling/calendaring app, throught iCal feeds.</p>

                        <p>Web-driven meetings are great, but video-conferencing makes them even more productive. Indico seamlessly integrates with Vidyo, allowing participants to connect with a single click. There is also built-in support for Jabber/XMPP chat rooms that can be associated to events.</p>
