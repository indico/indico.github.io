    name: interface
    text: |
        Building a registration form would be a tedious task, were it not for Indico's WYSIWYG form designer. Timetables can be easily managed using a powerful "drag and drop" interface. Rich text? Mathematical formulae? We have them! We are constantly trying to make Indico simpler to use and more user-friendly

    name: Hierarchical Protection Scheme
    text: |
        Indico was built with a large organisation in mind (CERN). This is why events are organised using a hierarchy of categories and protection of resources can be defined at several granularity levels. From small schools to large enterprises, Indico is the intuitive solution for organised and secure event storage.

        Indico wonâ€™t keep your data hostage. We believe in open collaborative platforms, and this is why we provide a simple and powerful REST API that allows for easy retrieval of information. The API is in constant expansion. You can also export your event data from your favorite scheduling/calendaring app, through iCal feeds.
