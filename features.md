    name: Hierarchical Protection Scheme
    text: |
        Indico was built with a large organisation in mind (CERN). This is why events are organised using a hierarchy of categories and protection of resources at several granularity levels. Different roles can be defined within an event as well. From small schools to large enterprises, Indico is the intuitive solution for organised and secure event storage.
