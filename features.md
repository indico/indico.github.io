  #   name: Hierarchical Protection Scheme
  #   text: |
  #       Indico was built with a large organisation in mind (CERN). This is why events are organised using a hierarchy of categories and protection of resources can be defined at several granularity levels. From small schools to large enterprises, Indico is the intuitive solution for organised and secure event storage.
