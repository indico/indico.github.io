Today, we are introducing **Indico 3.2**! This upcoming release is the result of about six months of development, and it includes many new privacy features that will make it easier for Indico events to be compliant with **data privacy laws** (e.g. GDPR). In addition, there has been work on modernizing some parts of the **user interface**, we've added a useful integration with **OwnCloud**, and the ability to **favorite events** along with some other features which we detail further below.

## Privacy features ‚öñÔ∏è

One big set of features arriving in version 3.2 are those related to privacy. We've added a new **privacy dashboard** in the event management page, which enables managers to designate a **data controller** and to set a custom **privacy notice**.

That privacy information will be clearly visible in all events: meetings will show it in a popup in the top right corner of the title ‚Äîas shown in the left image below‚Äî, and conferences in a separate page with its menu entry (right image).

</div>

Another addition is configurable **participant visibility**. This allows event managers to fine-tune who can see the participant list. The setting can be combination of showing participants to everybody or only other participants; and showing all of them, nobody or only the people who explicitly consent. It can be set up in registration forms, and when adding participants to a meeting. Event managers can also hide specific people.

If managers set the explicit consent request, registrants will be shown the different options in the form.

**Retention periods** have been added in multiple places: registration form, registration form fields and participant lists. This enables data to be forgotten at a certain time after an event has taken place.

## Favorite events ‚òÖ

Users can now have **favorite events**! This was a missing feature that completes users being able to set favorite categories.

To add an event to your favorites, just click on the star in the top button bar of the event's page.

Favorite events are now visible in the dashboard as well as in the favorites section of the user settings.

## New registration forms üéüÔ∏è

The **registration form** has been completely reworked and modernized, making it much easier to use by registrants and customise by the event managers. Many of the previous registration form limitations and bugs are now resolved, like the handling of long labels and titles.

All the fields which were available before are still there, but with improved looks and extended configuration options (including the retention period previously discussed in the privacy features).

### Accompanying persons field

Along the old fields, a new one for **accompanying persons** has been added. This field lets registrants add people who will attend the event as their guests.

> Another upside of the new registration form is plug-ins are now able to extend it in a much more neat way, hooking into it as well as adding custom field types.

</h2>

Cloud storage and online collaboration tools are widely used. Some times, event managers who have been working in one of these services want to upload files straight away to their meetings or conferences. To help in this task, we've integrated CERNBox into Indico. Event and category managers are now able to pick up files directly from their CERNBox space and attach them as materials.

For this, a new button has been added to the materials management page of both events and categories.

![](/assets/2022-06-10-indico-3-2-news/10-cernbox-button.png)

It will open a dialog with a browser to select the files they wish to attach from their personal CERNBox storage.

> "This new feature can be customized to use any ownCloud server, not just CERNBox. Indico server administrators can get it via a [new official plugin](https://github.com/indico/indico-plugins/tree/master/owncloud).
