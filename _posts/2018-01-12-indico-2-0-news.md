# Indico 2.0 is now stable and ready to be used!

After several years of hard work and more than 11 intermediate versions, **Indico 2.0**, the first stable version of the Indico 2 release series is now
**publicly** available and the **officially** supported version.
We've already shown you many of the new feature along the way (we advise you to read the last few posts), but there are a few resources we'd like to
highlight:

 * Our brand new [User Documentation Site](https://learn.getindico.io);
 * Our new [Technical Documentation Site](https://docs.getindico.io)
 * Our also new [Community Forum](https://talk.getindico.io)

We hope you will enjoy this new stable Indico release. Stay tuned for more updates through the [usual channels](/contact)!
