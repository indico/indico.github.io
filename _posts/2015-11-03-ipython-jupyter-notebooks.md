We're happy to announce that Indico now supports the rendering of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (formerly known as IPython Notebooks). We believe this to be yet another important step in making Indico event more useful to our community.
Do you want to see how it looks? Try these two (public) notebooks uploaded by our users:
