We are proud to present to you a project we have been dreaming of for the last
decade, and which we are now happy to officially announce.

Present in more than 300 organizations worldwide, Indico is an essential tool
for thousands of researchers. Over the years, CERN received many requests from
partner institutions wanting to use it. As a consequence we opened up our own
server, **indico.cern.ch**, to the wider community, which has allowed so far
more than **6,000** researchers in more than 50 countries to organize their
workshops and conferences. The [“Global
Indico”](https://indico.cern.ch/category/5372/) category now hosts an impressive
**12,000 events**, all operating under a [fair use
policy](https://cern.service-now.com/service-portal?id=kb_article&n=KB0004606).
Encouraged by this critical mass, we are embarking on a new, ambitious mission:
to elevate scientific events on a global scale through a **dedicated server**.

indico.global will cater specifically to smaller research centers, laboratories,
universities, and educational institutions lacking the resources or expertise to
establish their own Indico server. It will offer the complete Indico experience,
supported by a production-grade service from the same team that develops the
tool at CERN. Best of all, this service will remain free to use for all users!

indico.global is set to launch in **December 2024**, so mark your calendars and
stay tuned for more updates and detailed instructions on how to host **your
event** on indico.global!

In addition, the existing [“Global
Indico”](https://indico.cern.ch/category/5372/) category will be **migrated** to
indico.global at the beginning of 2025. After the migration, all links pointing
to Global Indico events on indico.cern.ch will automatically redirect to the
new domain.

If you currently use "Global Indico", you will receive an email with the
timeline and additional information to help you prepare for the upcoming
migration.

We look forward to welcoming you all in the Indico community!
