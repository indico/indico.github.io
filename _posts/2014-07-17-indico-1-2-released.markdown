It is with great enthusiasm that we announce the world wide release of Indico 1.2. This is the result of around one year of work which involved profound changes in Indico's internals (namely the move to Flask and the refactoring of the authentication code) and many interface improvements (e.g. Registration Form and Room Booking).

Full details available in our [GitHub site][github].
