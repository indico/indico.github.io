## ♿️ Accessibility improvements (a11y)

The accessibility of Indico has been improved in this release, in-line with the [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). This means that Indico is now easier to use by people with disabilities, including those who are blind, deaf, or have limited mobility. Notable improvements include:

- Making language selection, timezone selection and search functionalities more accessible to those using screen readers
- Preventing icons from being read out by screen readers
- Including the selected language in the page metadata (for screen readers)

## 📱 Check-in app

The existing **Indico check-in mobile application** has been **completely rewritten**. Instead of a native app released on two separate platforms (Google Play Store and Apple App Store), it is now a progressive web app (PWA) which can be easily installed on the two major phone OSs (Android and iOS) and used offline. The new app is available for all Indico instances running version 3.3 - you can [try it out here](https://checkin.getindico.io/).

Despite being hosted on [getindico.io](getindico.io), we do not collect any data from the app. The app only communicates with the Indico instance that you configure and all data is stored locally on the phone.

## 🧾 Receipts

A long-awaited feature: Indico now supports the generation of fully customizable PDF documents. You can create **receipts**, **certificates of attendance** or any other document you might need. Once generated, participants can download their documents from the registration page.

## 📅 "By Weekday" Recurring Bookings

The Room Booking module now supports **recurring bookings that repeat on specific weekdays**. For example, you can now create a recurring booking that repeats every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday over a set period of time.

## ⚖️ Privacy improvements (GDPR compliance)

Users can now be anonymized in Indico; this means that all personal identifiers associated with a user will be removed from Indico, whilst only keeping the data that is required for Indico to function properly, in an anonymized manner. In addition to this, users can now export a copy of all their personal data stored in Indico (data portability).

<!-- Holding this back for now, since this feature isn't merged yet...
## 🎟️ Google Wallet Integration

Registration tickets can now be saved directly to Google Wallet. This allows users to easily access their tickets on their mobile device, without having to download and print the ticket (where applicable).

## 🔗 Auto-linker for minutes

This feature allows Indico administrators to define specific text patterns which will be automatically linked when the patterns are used in minutes. This will save you time when adding links to e.g. ticketing systems, issue trackers or any other external systems. This feature is available for both the Markdown and HTML editor.

## 🇮🇹 Ciao Indico!

Italian has been added as a new language in Indico. This was done thanks to a team of volunteer translators who worked hard to make Indico even more familiar to the more than 65 million italian speakers around the world. We promise the translation is pineapple-free.
