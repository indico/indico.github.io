Indico was conceived as the Swiss Army Knife of event organizers. Since 2004, we have contributed to the success of
thousands of conferences and workshops around the world. In recent years, we have expanded our feature set, never
forgetting Indico's initial goal: to simplify basic operations in event organisation and to make life easier for both
organizers and participants.

A proof of this commitment with the organisation of small and larger events alike is this new release that we have
prepared for our users. It targets mostly the **Registration Form** feature, which until now was a exclusive feature
of conference events.

## More Registration Forms

The first big change is that **Registration Forms are no longer exclusive to conference events**. We have seen far too
many cases of people wanting to couple the simplicity of a meeting layout with the flexibility of Indico's registration
form. We will keep moving in this direction, allowing people to use different configurations of building blocks.

Although enabled by default in conferences and meetings, the registration feature can be used in lectures as well, if
enabled from the **Features** dialog (**Advanced Options**). You will notice that the same is true for the **Payment**
module, which we will mention below.

You can also now have **more than one registration form** per event. This especially useful if you require different
information from different kinds of participants.

## A single workflow that covers more ground

The equivalent of the **Registration** process in Indico meetings was, until now, the **Participants** feature, a
lightweight equivalent that supported slightly different workflows. Over the years, we've realized that most features in
both systems were actually **complementary**. This is why this new release includes a single, more complete registration
workflow that aims at covering all use cases that were previously supported by two different modules.

This is why Registration Forms now support an **invitation-based workflow** as well as **moderation**. We hope this will
allow organizers to have better control over who takes part in their events.

## More options, less complexity

The old **Registration Status** feature helped organizers keep track of information that should not, in principle, be
visible to users. It was just a simple list of tags, which was clearly not enough for the needs of some of our users.
We've tried to solve this in a flexible and simple way: you can now create **Administrative Sections**, parts of the
Registration Form that are **not user visible** but that can be set up with the same degree of flexibility.

**Multi-option fields** are now even more powerful. You can allow users to specify "+1" slots (useful for guests) and
optionally charge them for it.

We have also simplified things by removing functionality that is easy to reproduce with the features we currently offer.
This is the case of:

 * the **Social Events** section, which can be easily created using a "Multi-option" field;
 * the **Sessions** selector, which be, once again, can be done using a "Multi-option" field;

By default, you will now only see a "Personal Data" section, containing no more than title, first and last name, e-mail,
affiliation, address and phone number. All fields, with the exception of first/last name and e-mail, can be disabled.
That's the **bare minimum** conference organizers need and any other fields/sections you need can be easily added.

## A better (and faster) registrant list

Managing events with hundreds (or thousands) of participants is not easy, and we've been gradually trying to improve
the performance and user experience of Indico in a way that larger volumes of participants are easier to manage. There's
certainly a lot of work to be done in that direction, but we've taken yet another important step: the **List of
Registrants** is now **faster than ever** and includes a powerful filtering system that merges the old **Apply filters**
and **Columns to display** functionalities.

## Last but not the least...

We've been gradually trying to "tidy up" our menus. In the last release, you've already seen them reorganized. This
time, we decided we would permanently move options that concern the event as a whole (**Lock**, **Clone** and
**Delete**) to the **Event actions** bar. **Lock** and **Clone** were already there, but **Delete** has now joined them
as well. They have also been removed from the **Tools**/**Utilities** page.

Since **Delete** is now easier to access, we've also made sure that the probability that people would accidentally delete
any content (despite all the warnings) would be minimal. You will have to explicitly toggle a check box if you really
want to do so.

The overall menu structure has also changed a little bit:

 * **Advanced options** now includes as well "Offline Copy" (which was a "Tool" before);
 * The old **Services** menu item has been renamed **Logistics** - this contains, for now, **Webcast and Recording**,
 but may be enriched with other services in the future;
 * Some **advanced options** have been moved to two new sections:
   - **Services**, containing everything related to collaborative tools and services that are not necessarily provided
directly by Indico (Videoconference, Agreements, Logistics and Chat Rooms);
   - **Reports**, containing information about the event - Statistics, Logs and Lists of speakers, conveners, etc...


## Thank you!

It's been quite a long list of changes, but all of them have the sole purpose of making things **simpler** and **easier
to understand**. We're confident that this new release has succeeded in doing that, and we hope it will serve as a model
for the next steps in this pathway to **Indico 2.0**.

As usual, we are looking forward to your feedback! Thanks for your time!
