We are happy to announce that [indico.global](https://indico.global) is now
available to research centers, laboratories, universities, and educational
institutions for them to organize and host meetings, lectures and conferences,
if they do not have the means to operate a dedicated Indico server. The service
remains free and accessible within our fair use policy, ensuring that every
researcher has the tools they need to manage their events.

All events from the old “Global Indico” category on
[indico.cern.ch](https://indico.cern.ch) have been successfully migrated to the
new service and all links pointing to Global Indico events on indico.cern.ch now
automatically redirect to indico.global.

We invite you to explore this new space, and reach out if your institution would
like to use it for its own events. Stay connected with the global research
community, and continue to host your scientific events with indico.global.
