It is with great pleasure that we announce that **Indico 1.1** has been released.

Here are some of the most relevant ones:

## Interface

* New "User Dashboard" and "favorite categories" features
    * Separate Redis setup required
* Re-designed Room Booking module, user-friendly interface
* New user-friendly Event Log

## API

* Now accessible using cookie authentication (from within Indico, with CSRF token);
* Compatibility with Indico Mobile

## Misc

* Speakers can now have submission rights in lectures
* Paper reviewing managers, referees and reviewers have now permission to upload papers on behalf of the author

* Room Booking - Room can now be changed after reservation is cloned

## Fixes

* Author ordering in Book of Abstracts

* ... and many others!

## Indico Mobile

Another important fact is that any 1.1+ Indico setup can pair up with â€‹[Indico mobile][mobile]. There is no stable release date foreseen for Indico Mobile, but the GitHub version is now in production at CERN and being actively developed.

We hope you like it!
