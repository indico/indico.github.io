It's with great joy that we announce the public release of **Indico 3.0**. You can consult a summary of the main
changes [here](https://talk.getindico.io/t/indico-3-0-released/).

## Python 3 üêç

This major release starts the new **Python-3 era** of Indico.

Due to the massive changes that come with this, make sure to read the [2.x to 3.0 upgrade guide](https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/#upgrading-from-2-x-to-3-x)
if you plan to upgrade an existing instance.

As usual, but especially for a major upgrade like this, please make sure to read and understand the setup guide first and have a backup.

## Version 2.3

Version 2.3 will only receive updates for critical bugs and security issues from now on. Updating to 3.0 is highly recommended.
