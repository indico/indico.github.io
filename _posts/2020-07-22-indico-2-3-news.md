We are very proud to announce **version 2.3** of Indico which will be coming soon. This is the product of many months of development effort which encompassed, among others, the greatest world-wide lockdown ever seen.
But even during the peak of the pandemic, Indico development never ceased, thanks to the resilience of the team and the help of the community.

The result is one of the richest Indico updates seen to date, with the new **Paper Editing** workflow representing the bulk of the effort but also including a plethora of improvements and fixes in **various parts of the application**, in great part thanks to **contributions from the Community**. In this regard, we would like to thank in particular the team managing Indico at the **United Nations Office at Geneva** for their contributions back to the Indico code base, as well as **IEEE** for having funded some of the developments.

You will find below a list of the most relevant features. The [release changelog](https://docs.getindico.io/en/latest/changelog/#version-2-3) provides a full account of all improvements and bug fixes.

## Editing Module

The flagship feature of this Indico release is the brand-new **Editing** module. It is meant to augment the features offered by the already existing **Peer reviewing** module (previously called **Paper Reviewing**), by providing an integrated and customizable workflow for **Academic Paper Editing**, as well as associated materials (posters and slides).

### Choose what to review

You may choose which files in your contribution you would like to be reviewed - would you like to review the slides of all presentations? No problem.

### Decide which files are accepted

The new **Editing** module introduces the concept of **File type**. Not only can you decide which file extensions are accepted and which naming conventions have to be followed, you can also decide which files are necessary for reviewing to be possible.

### Wait for the files to arrive

Indico will **enforce** the file extensions and name format defined above.

### Review the submitted material

Whether it's **papers, posters or slides**, you will be able to request and suggest changes, as well as accept or reject the submission.

Thanks to this feature, it is now easy to see whether your speakers have already **registered or not**.

## Contributions and Timetable

### "Draft" state for Contribution List

![](/assets/2020-07-22-indico-2-3-news/upload_fbfc85fb57d8af26b7c374205d876ed7.png)

The **Contribution List** of new events will from now on be, **by default**, in **"Draft" state**. This ensures that contributions and all related menu items (e.g. Contribution List, Author List, Speaker List, Timetable) will be hidden from visitors. Whenever you are ready to publish your timetable, you can switch it to **"Published" state**.

> info "Attention"
> This is only valid for newly-created events. Old events will remain in "Published" state unless changed.

### Programme Codes

Indico can now generate **programme codes** for (sub-)contributions, session and session blocks, based on **pre-configured sequences**. These codes can be bulk-assigned and used to identify the corresponding event structures.

## Protection and ACLs

### Limit access to Registrants

![](/assets/2020-07-22-indico-2-3-news/upload_a9261e822dbd56d898266868aadea80b.png)

A highly requested feature since some time, events can now be set as accessible to **registrants/participants only**.

### Category Roles

![](/assets/2020-07-22-indico-2-3-news/upload_c4044866bad8f5b03ace5bdc065ce366.png)

Category-specific groups of users (**Category Roles**) can now be created. They can be used across the category, allowing for more efficient protection of your events.

![](/assets/2020-07-22-indico-2-3-news/upload_692b96675216cd986525e414d6507c15.png)

These list of roles can also be imported from CSV files.

### Import Roles from CSV file

User lists for roles (including new "Category Roles") can now be **imported from CSV files**.

### "Add myself" button

![](/assets/2020-07-22-indico-2-3-news/upload_ff6dae3dfc69cbc9f6c62b8f11353169.png)

You can now easily **add yourself** to any author list (abstracts/contributions).

### Clearer display of implicit permissions

Some roles may imply, by definition, having access to the event. Indico now displays those in a clear way.

## Abstracts

### Editing Permissions

![](/assets/2020-07-22-indico-2-3-news/upload_d8d876740d1b2b44edd99de76da6bd78.png)

A recurring problem with some events was that allowing all (co-authors) to edit an abstract was undesirable. This behaviour can now be fine-tuned. You get to choose you can edit an abstract and later get submission rights over the resulting contribution.

### Affiliation checks

When assigning papers to reviewers/judges managers are now shown the affiliation of the person in question, as well as a warning in case it overlaps with that of the paper.

### Download Book of Abstracts in LaTeX

![](/assets/2020-07-22-indico-2-3-news/upload_dbf54dd6da1e32c8f32a0eb4882c5d04.png)

If you need to make changes to your **Book of Abstracts** before having it published/printed, you now can **extract the LaTeX source code** directly from Indico!

### Track Groups

You can now group tracks together. "**Track groups**" allow you to have more fine-grained control over your abstracts while keeping things organized.

## Room Booking

### "Quick Cancel"

Booking reminder e-mails now include a link to a "**quick cancel**" dialog.

#### Profile Photo

You can now **set a photo** on your Indico profile. We plan to slowly start using this image in places where your name shows up.

> note "Note"
> This is obviously **opt-in**  and there is **no synchronization** with any identity providers (e.g. LDAP, CERN profile...).

#### Improved Profile Layout

Still recognizable, but more spacious and more usable!

#### Download Events in ICS/iCal

You can now download an ICS feed with the events on your profile. This allows you to keep track of your Indico events on your mobile phone on favourite desktop Calendaring application.

### Override Map URL

![](/assets/2020-07-22-indico-2-3-news/upload_1ab6706a860282efa93e107da23a480f.png)

You can now **override the Map URL** which will show up on your event's **display page**. Before you could only have a map URL for rooms managed by Indico.

## UI Improvements

### "Navigate" Button

![](/assets/2020-07-22-indico-2-3-news/upload_8017ee4db3dae4a76ac260435a79e1c0.png)

The new **Navigate** button allows you to quickly search for categories and access them directly.

### Better time picker

![](/assets/2020-07-22-indico-2-3-news/upload_b0183feb40f8602e954b3f180111a9ba.png)

We regularly get feedback from users who have **issues** with their browser's **default time picker** widget (most often on Microsoft Edge). This could result in some users being locked in to AM/PM instead of 24h, or even "buggy" behaviour.

In order to save some of our users from that frustration, we have decided to use an **Indico-specific time picker widget**. We still believe general-purpose browser-based widgets are the way to go, but unfortunately not all browsers are fully there yet.

## Administration

### Block User

There is now an interface to block a user.
