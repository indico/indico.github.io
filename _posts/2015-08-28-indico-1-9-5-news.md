We're proud to announce a new Indico release (1.9.5). We have worked hard to simplify some advanced features that are nonetheless very
important for our user community.

First of all, there is a new way to activate and deactivate Indico features. The new **feature selector** will simplify event management
and leave complexity to power users. In the future, most Indico advanced features will be toggled in this way. For now, only a couple of them
(Surveys and the Image Editor) can be managed.

The most important change in this release is a completely new version of the Survey feature (formely known as "Evaluation").

Many new things were added, such as the possibility of having **more than one survey** per event, support for **"sections"** and a
**drag and drop** interface.

Conference organizers will be happy to know we have also added drag and drop support for the **menu editor**. The layout settings
of conferences are also now much simpler to work with.

The "Image manager" has also been reworked. Dragging and dropping of image files is now supported, in the same way that it is already
possible for materials.

Another new interface that the conference managers will enjoy is the event **layout management** page. Adding a conference logo, editting the colours of the conference page and the rest of the existing features have now been polished with a brand new design.

As you may have noticed in the above images, several pages in Indico, such as the event management page, room booking as well as the category management page, have received a new **menu layout**, grouping menu items together based on their type, for a better and easier navigation.

We hope you will like this new release. We will be back soon with new things!
